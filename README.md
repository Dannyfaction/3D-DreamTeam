# 3D-DreamTeam The Awakened
This was the biggest project that we had on our school. We had 8 weeks and a group of 9 people to make a 3D game based off a Myth. We had chosen the 'Dreamcatcher' myth and were about to make a Hack and Slash game where you had to collect souls in your Dreamcatcher. Controlled with an Xbox Controller. 

We had a lot of discussions about who makes what and such. It was pretty hard to be a lead of this project as we had some stubborn (and lazy) people in our project group.

Certain agreements were not met such as rules about art and code, which made this a very messy project with a lot of people involved.
